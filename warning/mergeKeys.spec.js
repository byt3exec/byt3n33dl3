// from react-motion mergeDiff
// core keys merging algorithm. If previous render's keys are [a, b], and the
// next render's [c, b, d], what's the final merged keys and ordering?

// - c and a must both be before b
// - b before d
// - ordering between a and c ambiguous

// this reduces to merging two partially ordered lists (e.g. lists where not
// every item has a definite ordering, like comparing a and c above). For the
// ambiguous ordering we deterministically choose to place the next render's
// item after the previous'; so c after a

// this is called a topological sorting. Except the existing algorithms don't
// work well with js bc of the amount of allocation, and isn't optimized for our
// current use-case bc the runtime is linear in terms of edges (see wiki for
// meaning), which is huge when two lists have many common elements
